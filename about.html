  <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
  
  <p>Salutations! The name's Vatekeh Corlon and I'm the village goofball of a small town in Delaware; turned problem solver who happens to know all the words to Whitney Houston “be my baby tonight”. I’m 20 years old and have been coding since 16 and professional for almost 2 years now. I’m a self started and always eager to learn from my peers and IT elders. Follow The Misadventure of Vatekeh and friends as they dare to face off against the trials of adulthood. </p>

  <h3>Why Stoc Driey?</h3>
    <p>Challenge | Parents | Data Science</p>

  <p>I started developing this app as a challenge to myself to see how fast I could Learn and implement new software and methodologies.  I’m a Full stack Dev who works primarily in the frontend. My main tools are HTML, CSS(SASS sometimes), JSX, and reactJS/reactNative as my foundation for making things. For this project in particular I had to learn .NET which was a Framework completely Foreign to (though not oblivious ) me until now; Along with python and C# which were my first languages I started with way back In high school before moving to my default stack(js/css/html). My parents always implored the important of starting asset curation early so this was also a good excuse to learn more about different times of equity like flex income and concepts like dividends. Last but not least I really think Data Science is cool and wanna eventually move into Machine learning and natural language one day. Python is killing the game(R fans can fight me!) and what better way to learn data Science then to just play around with data haha.

  <h3>Is It Finished?</h3>
  <p>
  I’m always working on expanding my projects and keeping their source code up to date.
This project has reached it’s minimum viable potential but could be sooo much more then what it is at this moment. I plan to add Google’s Tenser Flow API to make predictions based on historical stock data along with other features like Full</p>
  
 <p>
If you would like to stay up to date with Stoc Driey’s development and even pitch in to add to it’s stock Drieyness, feel free to fork It’s repository on Github!
